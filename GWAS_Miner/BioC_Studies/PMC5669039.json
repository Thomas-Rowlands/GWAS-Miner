IP3 is released into the cytosol and acts at the endoplasmic reticulum where it binds to ligand-gated ion channels to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+. DAG remains bound to the plasma membrane where it activates two major signaling molecules, protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (RasGRPs), which initiate the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.

The human RNA sequencing data overview, QC and analytic methods are available at the following Synapse pages, respectively: syn3163039, syn6126114, syn6090802. Multivariable linear regression was used to test for association of gene expression levels with AD diagnosis (Dx) using two different models: In the Simple model, we adjust for age at death, sex, RNA integrity number (RIN), tissue source, and RNAseq flowcell. In the Comprehensive model, we adjust for all these covariates, and brain cell type markers for five cell-specific genes (CD68 (microglia), CD34 (endothelial), OLIG2 (oligodendroglia), GFAP (astrocyte), ENO2 (neuron)) to account for cell number changes that occur with AD neuropathology. TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are significantly higher in AD temporal cortex prior to correcting for cell types (Simple model), but this significance is abolished after adjusting for cell-specific gene counts (Comprehensive model). This suggests that these elevations are likely a consequence of changes in cell types that occur with AD, most likely microgliosis given that TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are microglia-enriched genes (Supplementary Table 19, Supplementary Figure 12).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34744, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34767, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Competing Financial Interests Statement         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34827, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Robert R.
