# GWAS Miner

## Overview
GWAS Miner was created as part of my PhD project at the University of Leicester, tackling the problem of extracting
 meaningful data from GWAS publication text.
 
## Features
- Extraction of genotype to phenotype associations, including genetic marker, disease and significance score (p-value).
- Visualisation of entity recognition and sentence structure within GWAS publication text.
- View publication statistics such as number of ontology disease term occurrences.

## Running GWAS Miner
GWAS Miner can be utilised both with a graphical user interface and through passing command line parameters.
Launching the graphical user interface can be done by passing the `-g` parameter to GWASMiner.py, allowing quick
 and easy access to all of it's features.

### Input Files
GWAS Miner is designed to utilise BioC-JSON files such as those generated by the Auto-CORPus project (https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus), including the produced Tables-BioC JSON files.
 
### Graphical User Interface 
```
python GWASMiner.py -g
```

### Command line
The following subset of features are available without launching the graphical user interface.

##### Process files within a directory
```
python GWASMiner.py -d <path_to_directory>
```

##### Update ontology cache
```
python GWASMiner.py -u
```

##### Visualise entities identified within a document
```
python GWASMiner.py -d <path_to_file> -g "ents"
```

##### Visualise sentence dependencies within a document
```
python GWASMiner.py -d <path_to_file> -g "sents"
```
